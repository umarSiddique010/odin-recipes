    <p>
      These shredded Brussels sprouts with bacon and pine nuts taste fantastic!
      When I mentioned bringing Brussels sprouts to a holiday get-together, my
      mom told me not to bother. After eating this dish, my family now requests
      I bring this dish to every get-together!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>½ pound sliced bacon</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>⅔ cup pine nuts</li>
      <li>2 pounds Brussels sprouts, cored and shredded</li>
      <li>3 green onions, minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon seasoning salt</li>
      <li>pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until
        crisp. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of grease in the skillet, crumble
        and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter with reserved bacon grease in the same skillet over medium
        heat. Add pine nuts; cook and stir until browned. Add Brussels sprouts
        and green onions; season with seasoning salt and pepper. Cook over
        medium heat until sprouts are wilted and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir
        in crumbled bacon just before serving.
