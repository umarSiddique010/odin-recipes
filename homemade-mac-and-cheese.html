      This homemade mac and cheese is topped with buttered bread crumbs for pure
      comfort food. It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch, starting
      with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan to make a rich,
      decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Macaroni and Cheese:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bread Crumb Topping:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
      <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted
        water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until
        tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in
        the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet
        over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes
        paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually whisk 2 ½ cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a
        simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with
        salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and
        sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
      <li>
        Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet
        over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and
        browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with
        paprika.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni
        and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
